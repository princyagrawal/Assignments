Amazon.com, Inc.[6] (/ˈæməˌzɒn/), is an American multinational technology company based in Seattle, Washington that focuses in e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.

Amazon is the largest e-commerce marketplace and cloud computing platform in the world as measured by revenue and market capitalization.[7] Amazon.com was founded by Jeff Bezos on July 5, 1994, and started as an online bookstore but later diversified to sell video downloads/streaming, MP3 downloads/streaming, audiobook downloads/streaming, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. The company also owns a publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, a film and television studio, Amazon Studios, produces consumer electronics lines including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TV, and Echo devices, and is the world's largest provider of cloud infrastructure services (IaaS and PaaS) through its AWS subsidiary.[8] Amazon has separate retail websites for some countries and also offers international shipping of some of its products to certain other countries.[9] 100 million people subscribe to Amazon Prime.[10][11]

Amazon is the largest Internet company by revenue in the world[12] and the second largest employer in the United States.[13] In 2015, Amazon surpassed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the United States by market capitalization.[14] In 2017, Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion, which vastly increased Amazon's presence as a brick-and-mortar retailer.[15] The acquisition was interpreted by some[by whom?] as a direct attempt to challenge Walmart's traditional retail stores.[16]
